# Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #8 Multiply Two 4×4 Matrices (Element-wise)

🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge demonstrates how to multiply two matrices element by element and store the result in a third matrix.

Each value in the result matrix is produced by multiplying the corresponding values from the two input matrices.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Working with multiple matrices simultaneously
- Element-wise matrix multiplication
- Traversing two-dimensional arrays
- Designing clear and reusable functions
- Understanding data alignment in matrix operations

---

🧩 Core Algorithm Concept
-
The algorithm processes corresponding positions:

MatrixResult[i][j] = Matrix1[i][j] × Matrix2[i][j]

This reinforces spatial awareness and data consistency across matrix dimensions.
